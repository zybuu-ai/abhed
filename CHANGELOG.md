# Changelog

All notable changes to Abhed are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Uploads no longer land in `.abhed/`, the directory the agent is denied. A
  deployment carrying the ordinary `read(**/.abhed/**)` rule refused every file
  a user attached, and the model reported it as a policy denial for a document
  it had just been handed. Attachments now go to `<workspace>/uploads/`.
- The upload endpoint requires session ownership. Any authenticated caller
  could previously write a file into another user's session directory, which
  the victim's agent then read as untrusted input.
- Policy rules can scope tools whose argument is not `command` or `path`.
  `deny k8s_get(secrets*)` compiled and never fired, and because `k8s_get` is
  read-only the read was auto-approved in auto mode.
- Pipeline tool arguments escape substitutions, so untrusted prior-step or RAG
  output cannot close a JSON string and change the arguments a tool receives.
- The legacy MCP SSE transport pins its POST endpoint to the configured
  origin, so a hostile server cannot redirect client posts — and the auth
  headers they carry — to an arbitrary URL.
- Extension `environ` layers on the inherited environment instead of replacing
  it, so setting one variable no longer drops `HOME`, `PATH` and the locale.

### Added

- `max_budget_tokens` is enforced on the primary agent, not only at
  subagent-spawn time. A session that exhausts its allowance ends with the
  terminal reason `max_budget`.
- Sessions record how full the context was, not only what they cost.
  `context_tokens` and `context_window` sit alongside the cumulative token
  totals in the session record and the `session.ended` event.
- The CLI shows a thinking indicator while the model works, completes slash
  commands as they are typed, and displays the model's reasoning, collapsed by
  default and expanded with `/think`.

### Fixed

- A session ended by server shutdown records the terminal reason `shutdown`
  rather than `user_interrupt`, so the audit log can tell a user stopping a run
  from the process going away.
- Every terminal reason is now either emitted in live code or marked reserved.
  Nine were defined, six reachable, and the README claimed eight.
- `exit` and `quit` end an interactive CLI session. Without a leading slash
  they were sent to the model as a prompt.

### Documentation

- The `vm` sandbox tier is documented as gVisor, which is what ships, rather
  than a Firecracker or Kata microVM, which does not.
- The security document states that the opt-in network tools execute outside
  the sandbox boundary, and which of them auto mode approves without a prompt.
- Benchmark results separate token count from cost, with the input and output
  split, because tokens are only cost on a hosted per-token API.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-15

The first public release of the Community Edition.

### Added
- The agent loop with tool contracts, a tiered execution sandbox, and a
  permission engine whose deny rules hold in every mode.
- Twenty model providers over three wire formats, chosen per session.
- Five ways to run it: interactive, headless (`-p`), JSON events per line,
  JSONL RPC over stdio, and a single-tenant server with a web console.
- A Go SDK that gives your own program the same loop with the same policy
  and audit guarantees, including validated structured output.
- An append-only audit record with replay, fork from any step, and export,
  in memory or in Postgres with row-level security.
- Skills, extensions (JSONL over stdio, veto-only), MCP servers, and
  parallel subagents in git worktrees.
- `abhed doctor`, which proves the endpoint answers, tool calling works,
  and a command runs under the sandbox before you trust a run.
